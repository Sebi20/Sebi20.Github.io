		<p>BIO:
			<br>
			I am a young overacheiver from Brooklyn,New York, whose life goal is to become an entrepreneur and use my gained wealth to help the people and communities around me who are struggling. Everyday when I pass the homeless male/female on the street, it gives me more motivation to become a helping hand, someone who can take them off the streets and give them jobs, so they inturn get shelter and food to survive. I can acheive this goal by working even harder and harder. Some people say the sky is the limit, but I see no limit yet, my limit is beyond the sky.</p>
