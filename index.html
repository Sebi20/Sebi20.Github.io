	  <p><br>I am a very adaptable person, meaning changes don't effect my work ethic.</p>
	  <p> I do my best at all times.</p>
	  <p> I don't settle for an "ok" job well done.</p>
	  <p> I'm competitive and will always try to be the best in everything.</p>
	  <p> I always take responsibility for my own actions, whether right or wrong.</p>
	  <p>I am a skeptical person, meaning that I question everything.</p>
	  <p>I  constantly challenge myself to be the greatest.</p>
	  <p>I constantly work; very energetic.</p>
	  <p>I am a team player,but I can work with or without one.</p>

	  	<br>
	  	<p> I can accomplish anything, when I put my mind to it.</p>
	  	<p> I like a good challenge.</p>
	  	<p> I rarely use excuses unless it's needed in a certain situation.</p>
	  	<p> My motto is: Work hard and get enough so I can retire early.</p>
	  	<p> Failure doesn't scare me, it teaches me.</p>

		<p>BIO:
			<br>
			I am a young overacheiver from Brooklyn,New York, whose life goal is to become an entrepreneur and use my gained wealth to help the people and communities around me who are struggling. Everyday when I pass the homeless male/female on the street, it gives me more motivation to become a helping hand, someone who can take them off the streets and give them jobs, so they inturn get shelter and food to survive. I can acheive this goal by working even harder and harder. Some people say the sky is the limit, but I see no limit yet, my limit is beyond the sky.</p>
