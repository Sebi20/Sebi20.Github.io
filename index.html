          <p>This project is a creation of 3 classes. A Vehicle class is created to define a vehicle. A Car class is created and inherits from the Vehicle class to define a car is. Finally a Parking-Lot class that stores the cars in a HashMap. It also checkin and checkout cars with the price of their stay.

          <p><strong>Key Tools:</strong> Java <img src="javaLogo.png" alt="" class="toolLogos"></p>
          <p>For this project I created a Contact class that defines a contact to have first/last name, address and phonenumber. I also created a ContactList class that holds contacts in an Arraylist. Users have the oppurtunity to add contacts and also return a list of contacts based on name and city.

            For this roject I created an Item class to define items in a store. A ShoppingCart class to store items with an ArrayList. A Shopper class that defines a shopper in a store. Finally I created a HardwareStore class where the user set the number of registers a store will have. The store will check the shopper out with the price of everything in the shoppers cart.
