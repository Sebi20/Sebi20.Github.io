<h1>#I'm the 3rd guy on the left</h1>
<p>My group and I are showing a demo of the website we created, called Rally; A website that bridges the gap between knowledge and action, visitors of the website are given real unbiased news and reports from all over the world, visitors are also given the oppurtunity to basically read about and do something about social issues around the world. I was the front end developer of Rally, My job was to create the home page, login page, and helping to link to and find organizations that people can aide. I also gave a helpful hand to the back end and coding the way the website functions.</p>
